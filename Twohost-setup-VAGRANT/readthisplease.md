# A quick way to establish a testing environment for penetration testing

Special thanks to Vagrant for making it easy and fast to do this. 

If you haven't downloaded Vagrant yet, check how to install Vagrant by [clicking this link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install). Don't waste your time with setups while you can just focus on training!!

**Don't remember to make a new directory for this Vagrantfile and other Vagrantfiles too.**

*Have fun with the config!!*
